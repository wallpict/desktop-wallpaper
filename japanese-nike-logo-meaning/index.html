<p>Nike, originally known as blue ribbon sports (brs), was founded by university of oregon track athlete phil knight and his coach, bill bowerman, on january 25, 1964. Though on the earliest puma emblems the cat was leaping through the stylized letters “d”, which stood for the name of the brand’s founder, rudolf dassler. The nike logo was designed by carolyn davidson, a graphic design student at portland state university. The kobe bryant logo is composed of an abstract geometric symbol, consisting of six segments, which make up a figure, resembling a sword. The nike symbol is among the most popular and recognizable ones in the design world, but the nike logo history is actually a very simple one. There are many decisions to make when creating one, and one of the biggest is color. Pin by Diya Sharma on Football in 2020 Nike logo, Logos.</p>
